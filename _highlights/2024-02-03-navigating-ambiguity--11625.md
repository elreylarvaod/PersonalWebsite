title: Navigating Ambiguity.

My general advice is that you should only take on deeply ambiguous problems when an executive tells you to, and ensure that the executive is committed to being your sponsor. If not, the timing might be good, but you’re still extremely likely to fail. Flag the issue to your management chain, and then let them decide when they’re willing to provide the necessary support to make progress.
