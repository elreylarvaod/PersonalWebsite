title: How Big Technical Changes Happen at Slack

Phase 1: Exploration

Phase 1 is frictionless to enter. When an engineer first starts messing around with a technology theyâ€™re excited about, **no permission-granting process or ceremony is needed**. It probably happens dozens of times a day at Slack: someone reads about or invents something new, and commences fiddling around with it. Perhaps they have read a blog post about [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html), or [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/), or [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), or [TCR](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864). They download some software, build it, poke around a little, work through some introductory material, and maybe take a stab at applying it to their day job.
