title: Hard to Work With.
---

it *is* unfair to be forced to overcome a peer’s poor performance, that’s the manager’s job, but work isn’t a perfect place. Success is finding a path forward among the options that actually exist. Grinding yourself down in frustration about paths not existing doesn’t solve anything. It may take a few tries to learn this lesson, I certainly devoted quite a few years to learning it the hard way.
