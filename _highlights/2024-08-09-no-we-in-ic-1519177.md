**Thought Experiment**

I remembered this story during a conversation with a former Marine in Afghanistan who said, “There is no individual success without mission success.” I proposed a thought experiment based on this statement:

1.  Teams get ratings too
2.  No individual can get a rating higher than their team’s rating

No individual success without mission success.
