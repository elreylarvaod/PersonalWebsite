title: Making Engineering Strategies More Readable @ Irrational Exuberance
---

While I’ve generally found explore, diagnose, refine, policy, and operation to work well for writing policy, I’ve consistently found it a poor format for presenting strategy. Whether I’m presenting a strategy for review or rolling the strategy out to be followed by the wider organizaton, I recommend an inverted structure:

•   **Policy**: what does the strategy require or allow?
•   **Operation**: how is the strategy enforced and carried out, how do I get exceptions for the policy?
•   **Refine**: what were the load-bearing details that informed the strategy?
•   **Diagnose**: what are the more generalized trends and observations that steered the thinking?
•   **Explore**: what is the high-level, wide-ranging context that we brought into creating this strategy?
