note: I think the difference between this and true open source is interesting. The
  core artifact isn't open in that it can't be modified and improved over time. It's
  centralized by FB and in that way, the community depends on FB in a way that many
  open source projects do not. An example is React could pretty reasonably spin out
  of Meta and be fully external to the company, but the training data and the GPUs
  are owned by FB
