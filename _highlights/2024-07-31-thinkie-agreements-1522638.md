title: 'Thinkie: Agreements'
---

Pattern: You are locked in an argument & you want progress.

Transformation: Pause & make a list of everything you agree on.

“Heated Agreement” is an apparent argument where the participants are committed to the conversational form of arguing without actually disagreeing. It’s useful to catch heated agreement early. Then if you want to go on yelling at each other, fine, but also maybe you both have better things to do.
